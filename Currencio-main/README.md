## Project Description
Currency Converter is a simple and user-friendly project that allows users to convert currency rates from one currency to another. The project retrieves live exchange rate data from the Exchange Rate API and uses Java to perform the necessary calculations to convert the currencies.

The project consists of a GUI (Graphical User Interface) developed using Java Swing. The GUI allows users to select the input and output currencies and enter the amount they wish to convert. Once the user clicks the "Convert" button, the project retrieves the latest exchange rates from the API and calculates the converted amount.
